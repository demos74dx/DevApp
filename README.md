DevApp
======
You can see a preview on gh-pages http://demos74dx.github.io/DevApp/
<br/>
It will look slightly different due to fluid widths, the app runs at 1200x600px.
<br/>
This project uses Chrome Apps, here's how to make it work:
<ol>
<li>Clone it</li>
<li>Open chrome</li>
<li>Goto chrome://flags/</li>
<li>Enable Experimental Extension APIs (This add an apps bookmark to chrome)</li>
<li>Restart chrome</li>
<li>Tools->Extensions</li>
<li>Click the Developer Mode Checkbox</li>
<li>Click Load Unpacked Extension button</li>
<li>Navigate to the DevApp folder and select it</li>
<li>It should now be installed under your Program Files->Chrome Apps</li>
<li>or you can open a new tab and hit the new apps bookmark and pull it up from there.</li>
</ol>
From here you don't need to keep Loading the unpacked extension, changes are made immediately.
